He came from a Jewish family that had an artistic lean based on the many dancers and musicians that it produced. It wasn't until he was 15 that Marcel changed his last name to Marceau (after a famous French general), to hide his Jewish origins when France entered WWII. Both Marceau and his brother Alain worked in the French underground, often risking their lives to help Jews escape their occupied homeland. Young Marcel went so far as to portray a Boy Scout director to lead hundreds of young Jewish children on \"hikes\" in the Alps, helping them flee into Switzerland. By 1944, Marceau's father was deported to Auschwitz (where he died), and Marceau and his brother departed to Paris, where they felt safe. It was here that Marceau resumed his earlier dreams of being an actor, inspired by silent film greats like Chaplin, Keaton, and the Marx Brothers. But, despite his best efforts, he was again sidetracked by WWII when he was asked to be a liaison officer with Patton's army, because his English was so good. Finally in 1946, he enrolled in the renowned Charles Dullin School of Dramatic Art where he studied under Etienne Decroux, who introduced him to the art form of mime. Soon Marceau developed his own distinct style of mine, which was easily accessible to a mass audience. As his popularity grew, he created what he called \"mimodramas\" which led quickly to what is now known as modern mime. In 1947, Marceau developed a reoccurring character he called Bip. Modeled after his movie hero Chaplin's Little Tramp, Bip was the underdog, a melancholy sad sack dressed in a striped shirt, white sailor pants, and a top hat with a single red flower sprouting from the lid, that became his signature alter ego. Over the next ten years Marceau appeared on stage, screen, and television, making his mark in all art forms, although his live performance will be what he is best remembered for; it was in the 1950s that Americans everywhere were awakened to the magic of mime because of his appearances on television. While he did not appear in a multitude of films, Marceau did use his art to the fullest advantage. In First Class, he played 17 different roles; in Shanks he played the title character who is a deaf-mute puppeteer, allowing him to showcase his talent. He also appeared in Barbarella as Professor Ping, and was the only one with a speaking part in the Mel Brooks comedy Silent Movie. Marceau continues to appear in various projects but the majority of his life is spent teaching his life's work, so the art of mime will carry on past his legacy. ~ All Movie Guide",            "Monsieur Marceau has a school in Paris where he teaches his craft. People from all over the world go to France to study with him. Here in Puerto Rico, I know two actors/mimes/dancers who have studied with him: Ivan Olmo and Luis Oliva. And there also is 80 yr old mime/dancer/actress Gilda Navarra, who studied with the same mime that was Marceau's teacher, Etienne Decroux, in Paris. ( I studied with Gilda Navarra in the 70's.) \r\nI didn't give you a list of people, but I hope this bit of info. helps you. \r\nBy the way, Marcel Marceau is awesome!
